        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>On February 20, 2000, I was born in Seoul, South Korea. I mostly stayed in my grandparent's house as my parents were busy finishing their PhDs and work.</p>
        <p>During my lifetime, I have lived across multiple countries. When I was five years old, our family moved to Osaka, Japan, and lived there for three and a half years due to my father's job. In this period, I was capable of speaking two languages. I spoke Korean at home and Japanese in kindergarten. However, I now only use Korean and have forgotten most Japanese.</p>
        <p>Before I started attending primary school at the age of eight, we moved back to Seoul, South Korea, because my parents wanted me to focus mainly on Korean. They wanted me not to get confused about who I really am. We lived there until I finished the first semester of grade 4. At this time, I mainly studied English alongside schoolwork.</p>
        <p>For the rest of my grade four, I stayed away from my family and lived in a foreign country. My mom wanted me to experience different cultures and get fluent in English. Therefore, my parents sent me to Canada for six months to attend Regina Christian school, located in Regina, Saskatchewan. There were also other Koreans at my age living with Korean families. However, I was taken care of by a Canadian family I had never met. It was the most terrifying yet the best experience I have ever had.</p>
        <p>I came back to my family at the start of grade 5, but now my parents wanted to immigrate to the same city where I studied internationally in Canada. They determined to keep me away from South Korea because of its hellish school life. My parents thought I would have suffered severe depression had I stayed here.</p>
        <p>At the start of the second semester of grade 7, our family successfully immigrated to Regina, Saskatchewan. I was thrilled as I got to reunite with my old friends. Furthermore, every subject was less challenging than before. Therefore, my free time naturally increased a lot, and thanks to that, I got a lot of time to consider what I would do in the future. I was mainly choosing between becoming a doctor or a software engineer. In the end, I decided to become a software engineer because it fits perfectly with my personality. And, finally, I am here looking for a job.</p>
